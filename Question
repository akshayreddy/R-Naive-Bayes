Use the “naive bayes binary.csv” data. These data are for a 3-class classification
problem with 10 binary variables. The true class is the 11th column of the data file.
(a) Using the first half of the data set, train a naive Bayes classifier.
(b) Using the 2nd half of the data set, classify each vector and construct the confusion matrix.
